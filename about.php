                     Since its inception on January 12, 2012, Sunshine- the counselling cell at IIT- H, has been
                     committed to
                     helping the student community. The dedicated <a href="./team.php">team</a> of Sunshine comprises of
                     a Faculty in- Charge, three Psychological Counsellors,
                     nineteen faculty representatives, twelve student heads, thirty three management team members,

                     The Student Mentor Program is run by Sunshine, the counseling cell of IITH. The student mentors are
                     selected by the Sunshine counsellors through an interview and are trained in basic counselling
                     skills
                     thereby, making them competent to help other students in an unbiased manner and enabling them to
                     run the program in an efficient way.<br><br>
                     The student mentorship program is aimed at offering the incoming students, an interface to
                     understand and interact with the diverse student community at IITH. With the institute having a
                     strict anti-ragging policy, the program also doubles up as an excellent ice-breaker.<br><br>
                     <b>The objectives of the student mentor program include:</b><br>
                     <ul>
                        <li>Welcoming and orienting the new students of IITH.</li>
                        <li>Guiding the new students about life at IITH campus, the Student Gymkhana and its activities,
                           college fests, etc.</li>
                        <li>Providing academic guidance to the students.</li>
                        <li> Enforcing the anti-ragging rule.</li>
                     </ul><br>
                     On the whole, the
                     program aims to provide the incoming students with a cordial environment to make their transition
                     to
                     the IITH way of life as smooth and fun-filled as possible.
